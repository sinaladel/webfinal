    </header>
    <p>After college I want to keep performing as a magician, I took a break from performing for a while to work on
        myself
        and transition into myself. I'm much happier now, and ready to start performing again.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to magic, I want to work as a web developer for the time being until I can use development skills for
        magic
        or develop for a magic company. My dream company to work for would be Ellusionist!
